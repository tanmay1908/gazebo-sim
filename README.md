# gazebo-sim
A Gazeo simulation of my apartment. Uses different textures, walls, windows, doors, imported objects and objects designed in the model editor
The code also includes a script which prints "Welcome to Tanmay's world" when the simulation loads

To run, you need the latest version of Gazebo installed in your computer
Then in the therminal, navigate to src/world and run the following command:
```
$ gazebo world_rev_2.launch
```
Note: Rev2 is the current version. Might add new features in the future
